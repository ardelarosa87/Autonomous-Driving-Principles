# Autonomous-Driving-Principles

## Coming Soon
In this repository, I provide a comprehensive tutorial on the essentials of 3D object detection, a critical component in the realms of autonomous driving and robotics. The tutorial begins with an introduction to an unsupervised learning method to establish the foundational concepts. Following this, I will explore two key supervised deep learning models: PointNet and PointNet++. I will demonstrate how to develop and train these models using PyTorch, focusing on classification tasks within 3D point cloud data. This is particularly pertinent for applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics. The tutorial will also include a segment on advanced data fusion techniques. Here, I will show how to merge LiDAR data with imagery, using calibration methods on the KITTI dataset. This will be complemented with practical examples, illustrating a technique similar to PointPainting, providing valuable insights for those interested in autonomous driving and robotics.
