# Autonomous-Driving-Principles

## Coming Soon
This repository is dedicated to delving into four critical components widely utilized in the autonomous driving sector, specifically focusing on 3D object detection. Our journey begins with an in-depth exploration of an unsupervised method. Following this, we'll delve into two groundbreaking supervised deep learning methodologies that have significantly influenced this domain: PointNet and PointNet++. I will meticulously develop and train these algorithms from the ground up using PyTorch, targeting classification tasks within 3D point cloud data. Our exploration culminates with the integration of data fusion techniques, where we'll skillfully merge LiDAR data with imagery, utilizing calibration techniques on the KITTI dataset.
