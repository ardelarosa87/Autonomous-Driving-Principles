# Part I: Projection of LiDAR Data from 3D to 2D Pixel Space

In this first section, we delve into the process of projecting LiDAR data from a three-dimensional space into a two-dimensional pixel space. We will explore a range of techniques rooted in linear algebra and computer graphics to effectively achieve this transformation. This journey will encompass the understanding of essential concepts and the application of various computational methods to bridge the gap between 3D LiDAR data and 2D imagery.
